    <p class="margin">
    In the planning of my website I used a organiser application called Trello (trello)
    where I could organise my project into sections or focus on each individual question.
    I can the arrange the straight forward questions into categories and set them in a 
    different section that the questions that need a lot of attention or research. All in all
    this application has made organising my project so much easier and organising, I can create
    my project in a way where Iâ€™m not lost on what I need to do next.
