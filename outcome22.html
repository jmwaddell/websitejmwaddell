        I would say that all the IT tools I used whilst making my website were appropriate for 
        the task in hand. Trello made my organising of my project so much easier so I could 
        focus on the much harder tasks first and then save some of the easier stuff when the 
        more complicated stuff was completed. Visual Studio Code was where we implemented the 
        different methods we were selected for our projects, we used a html file for the base 
        file of our website and then we implemented methods with CSS and Javascript to make our 
        sites look a lot more appealing to the viewer.
