        I could possibly move my project forward and improve it by using a few animated images 
        or even the better, more readable fonts. I could possibly add a more easy to navigate 
        home page with a short description of the information on the hyper link. But most 
        importantly time management and planning is the key, if you over look one and not 
        the other it can cause alot more problems in the long run.
