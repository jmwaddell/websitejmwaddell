        The creating of my website was pretty straight forward but there were some inputs I 
        struggled with mainly due to lack of practice with said input. There was no catastrophic 
        failure with any of methods. Working in a team could be beneficial for the whole team 
        as people could use there specialised traits to make the website more efficient, plus 
        three to five pairs of eyes could spot a mistake in the code rather than just one pair 
        of eyes. The only problem I could see with working in a team would be if there was a 
        conflict of interests between the team.
