        Copyright can effect a website in a number of ways, it can effect it in a way where 
        the idea or concept of the website can be copy righted thus making it difficult to 
        add an application or web production of a similar kind no matter how improved it is 
        from the original. It can also effect web pages using copyrighted content such as 
        text or images, even methods in production can be copyrighted, I feel this can effect
        the progression of select technologies.
