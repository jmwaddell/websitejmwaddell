        There is a variety of methods and inputs you can use to implement your website and 
        personalise it to your own specification. Many of which can be implemented using the
        programme called Visual Studio Code where you can use multiple types of code such as
        Javascript, Html and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). All of these input methods can seem
        intimidating or scary but there are plenty of resource sites that can be used such as
        moodlecloud (https://developcoding.moodlecloud.com/) where you can find a lot of
        information and methods for your web page. References moodlecloud.
