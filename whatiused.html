    <p class="margin">
    Firstly we reviewed previous students projects and the varieties of code that we would need
    to use to make our projects successful. This was one of the many forms of research we used,
    we started doing activities and tasks off moodlecloud and started inputting and learning the
    ins and outs of Java Script. We then moved onto Html and then lastly onto CSS 
    (Cascading Style Sheet), we then had all the necessary tools and skills to start creating
    our webpages.
