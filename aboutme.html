   <p class="margin"> Hello my name is Jonathan Waddell, I am 26 years of age from 
    a town called Northwich based in west Cheshire. When I left school I wanted to
     follow in my fathers footsteps and go into the Royal Engineers, so I started a
     course in motor vehicle maintenance and repair and as I finished my second year
    there were not really any job opportunities for me in the motor trade and a 
    medical condition (Type 1 diabetes) prevented me from joining the royal 
    engineers.
    <br>
    <br>
 So I ended up looking into different career paths, In years to come I had a mixture
  of Jobs such as labouring for a company called Direct Property Maintenance, I got a
   mixture of skills from this line of work. I then went on to do a short stay at 
   Morrisons distribution where I was a quality control operative, I had to do
    various tasks during the day such as checking the quality of fruit and vegetables
    but also I had an admin roll of sorting excel sheets to display the food safe
    cleaning agents for each piece of machinery on the production line but the 
    pressure of the job was too much. That is where <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/">CodeNation</a> was mentioned to
    me, and here I am starting my coding journey.
