        There are a number of ways that disabilities can affect the way a customer or user uses
         a web application, there are also a number of implementations that can be used to make 
        the website more accessible for a person with select disabilities but first you need to 
        identify the underlying issues that some users with disabilities have. Some users need 
        options such as colour contrasting and background colour adjustment to make text more 
        easier to read, there can also be subtitles for informative videos for people with 
        hearing difficulties. Also some versions of sites can have none flashing backgrounds 
        or images to help people who are prone to Photosensitive seizures or even people with
        cognitive disabilities such as dementia and dyslexia.
