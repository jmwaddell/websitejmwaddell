        In the majority I am happy with my website, I enjoyed the majority of creating it there 
        are a few aspects I would like to change however. I would of managed my research time a 
        lot better as my website didnâ€™t need to be as complicated as I originally had planned, 
        I would also of changed the text font I used as although it is read able some characters 
        are a struggle to read.
