        On my first page I made it an intro of me and what I have done in the past for work, 
        basically a short but informative paragraph of my achievements and employment. For my 
        second page I went into the purpose of IT in a modern day business how it benefits and
        is important to make a business a successful business. For my third page I went into 
        the methods and skills that I would be using while creating my web page but also going 
        over the importance of each individual form of code. For my fourth page I explained all
         the risks that could possibly stop a digital production dead, I went into the possible 
         reasons to why both small and large productions can fail and the ways that the outcome 
         of failure can be prevented.

        For my fifth page I went over all the items that I used for my digital production and 
        the methods that I was going to use, we went over previous students work and sites and 
        this opened a few ideas up for our production. For my sixth page I analysed all the 
        tools that we were going to use and specified that our pages would look plain and 
        boring without html, CSS or Javascript. For my seventh and final page I went into all 
        the possible problems that the new Gdpr laws can have against digital projects as the 
        access to information is a lot more difficult and it makes the designing of said 
        digital projects a lot more complicated.
